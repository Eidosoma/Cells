# Feature requests

Requests for engine features from the user or from studies the user runs, with their priority, the
lead's mapping to the existing plan, and their status. Each becomes a design note before code (D142)
and a general feature, never one built for one study (D144).

| ID | Feature | Priority | Status | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [FR-1](#fr-1--a-closed-internal-compartment-on-the-shared-inventory) | A closed internal compartment on the shared inventory | **High** (user, 14 November 2026; the request's own label: priority 1, blocking) | Logged; design not started | A design note for a fixed-topology compartment (below) |

## FR-1 — A closed internal compartment on the shared inventory

**Logged 14 November 2026, high priority** (the user: "here is a new feature request please log as
high prioriity"). The request below is the requesting study's text, condensed. The lead's mapping
follows.

**The request.** A finite node that belongs to one cell rather than to the exterior:
- no bath connection, and no faces to other nodes;
- bounded by one membrane patch of its owning cell;
- with its own volume and its own rows of @3's one inventory;
- with transport routes across that bounding patch to the owner's cytosolic rows.

**Why it is general.** Secretory vesicles and granules: this is roadmap item 9's vesicle pool,
already wanted for connexin and morphogen supply. Also lysosomes and degradative compartments,
phagosomes, autophagosomes, and the ER and mitochondrial matrix as species compartments rather than
calcium-only ones.

**Why the study needs it.** Without it, an imported species lands in the same cytosolic row as free
cargo. The model cannot then tell "particle inside a vesicle" from "cargo in the cytosol", which is
the one distinction the study exists to keep.

**The request's own reading of the code** (corrected by the requester on 14 November; the lead
checked the cited lines):
- `restricted_cleft_lumen@1` is not most of this.
  - It is "a finite outside node opened at an insertion onset", not cell-owned.
  - Its volume follows the inserted patch's area, with no water flow.
  - It declares `VIEW_READS = ("membrane_area",)`, so membrane state and insertion are mandatory
    providers.
  - It refuses any source that is not a held, electroneutral bath (`restricted_lumen.py`).
- **The mutual refusal.**
  - The species operators refuse water, the lumens, insertion, partition and the bridge
    (`species_common.py`, `CONFLICTS_VIEW`; D152's refusals likewise).
  - The lumen requires insertion and membrane state.
  - So today a restricted compartment cannot carry inventory species rows with any law acting on
    them, in either direction.
  - This is the version 1.1 composition problem: the volume ledger and the `VIEW_READS`
    relaxation.
- **What transfers is the lumen's accounting:**
  - volume as state;
  - the mixing-heat Jensen gap for fluid of one composition entering a compartment of another;
  - the dilution term that brings @3's chemical term on the declared volume to the physical one.
- **What is missing:**
  - a node owned by a cell rather than by the exterior, with its bath and faces closed;
  - a membrane route for a neutral inventory species (D150 §2.6 refuses it until a material-rate
    bound exists on membranes and junctions: the queued D148 round, D155 and D156);
  - composition with a volume provider (version 1.1 and the volume ledger);
  - the transfer law itself.
- **The order, adopted from the requester's reviewer.** A compartment of fixed topology comes first.
  In it, retained material stays distinguishable from cytosolic material, and transfers reconcile
  on both sides. Dynamic internalisation (FR-2) follows it and does not gate it.

**The lead's mapping (for the design note to test, not settled).**
- **A fixed volume first.** A compartment of fixed topology and fixed volume needs no volume
  provider, so the species operators' refusal of water does not bind its first version. The
  volume-provider composition is its second step.
- **A transfer law that may already exist.** D150's `scheduled_species_exchange@1` already moves
  neutral species across a patch, between a cell and a finite node, with exact half-steps and its
  own bookings. If a cell-owned compartment node can be that patch's node, exchange may be the
  transfer law. It would then avoid the membrane-permeability route, which needs the D148 bound.
  - The design note should test this first.
- **The electrical treatment is the hard question.** @3's patches face outside nodes inside the
  extracellular field solve. A compartment inside the cell faces the cytosol. The note must say:
  - what the bounding patch's membrane voltage and the compartment's charge are;
  - whether the node takes part in the field solve;
  - for a neutral first version, whether the compartment can be electrically silent;
  - and whether the field-input node cap (64) is affected.
- **What it touches.** The S3 lumen's accounting patterns, D150's exchange and identity rules, the
  D148 round for neutral species on membranes, the volume ledger, and roadmap item 9.

**The plan entry.** It sits in CURRENT_PLAN's composition gate, high priority, after the work in
flight.
