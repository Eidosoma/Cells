# Feature requests

Requests for engine features from the user or from studies the user runs, with their priority, the
lead's mapping to the existing plan, and their status. Each becomes a design note before code (D142)
and a general feature, never one built for one study (D144).

## FR-1 — A closed internal compartment on the shared inventory

**Logged 14 November 2026, high priority** (the user: "here is a new feature request please log as
high prioriity"). The request below is the requesting study's text, condensed. The lead's mapping
follows.

**The request.** A finite node that belongs to one cell rather than to the exterior:
- no bath connection, and no faces to other nodes;
- bounded by one membrane patch of its owning cell;
- with its own volume and its own rows of @3's one inventory;
- with transport routes across that bounding patch to the owner's cytosolic rows.

**Why it is general.** Secretory vesicles and granules: this is roadmap item 9's vesicle pool,
already wanted for connexin and morphogen supply. Also lysosomes and degradative compartments,
phagosomes, autophagosomes, and the ER and mitochondrial matrix as species compartments rather than
calcium-only ones.

**Why the study needs it.** Without it, an imported species lands in the same cytosolic row as free
cargo. The model cannot then tell "particle inside a vesicle" from "cargo in the cytosol", which is
the one distinction the study exists to keep.

**The request's own reading of the code** (corrected by the requester on 14 November; the lead
checked the cited lines):
- `restricted_cleft_lumen@1` is not most of this.
  - It is "a finite outside node opened at an insertion onset", not cell-owned.
  - Its volume follows the inserted patch's area, with no water flow.
  - It declares `VIEW_READS = ("membrane_area",)`, so membrane state and insertion are mandatory
    providers.
  - It refuses any source that is not a held, electroneutral bath (`restricted_lumen.py`).
- **The mutual refusal.**
  - The species operators refuse water, the lumens, insertion, partition and the bridge
    (`species_common.py`, `CONFLICTS_VIEW`; D152's refusals likewise).
  - The lumen requires insertion and membrane state.
  - So today a restricted compartment cannot carry inventory species rows with any law acting on
    them, in either direction.
  - This is the version 1.1 composition problem: the volume ledger and the `VIEW_READS`
    relaxation.
- **What transfers is the lumen's accounting:**
  - volume as state;
  - the mixing-heat Jensen gap for fluid of one composition entering a compartment of another;
  - the dilution term that brings @3's chemical term on the declared volume to the physical one.
- **What is missing:**
  - a node owned by a cell rather than by the exterior, with its bath and faces closed;
  - a membrane route for a neutral inventory species (D150 §2.6 refuses it until a material-rate
    bound exists on membranes and junctions: the queued D148 round, D155 and D156);
  - composition with a volume provider (version 1.1 and the volume ledger);
  - the transfer law itself.
- **The order, adopted from the requester's reviewer.** A compartment of fixed topology comes first.
  In it, retained material stays distinguishable from cytosolic material, and transfers reconcile
  on both sides. Dynamic internalisation (FR-2) follows it and does not gate it.

**The lead's mapping (for the design note to test, not settled).**
- **A fixed volume first.** A compartment of fixed topology and fixed volume needs no volume
  provider, so the species operators' refusal of water does not bind its first version. The
  volume-provider composition is its second step.
- **A transfer law that may already exist.** D150's `scheduled_species_exchange@1` already moves
  neutral species across a patch, between a cell and a finite node, with exact half-steps and its
  own bookings. If a cell-owned compartment node can be that patch's node, exchange may be the
  transfer law. It would then avoid the membrane-permeability route, which needs the D148 bound.
  - The design note should test this first.
- **The electrical treatment is the hard question.** @3's patches face outside nodes inside the
  extracellular field solve. A compartment inside the cell faces the cytosol. The note must say:
  - what the bounding patch's membrane voltage and the compartment's charge are;
  - whether the node takes part in the field solve;
  - for a neutral first version, whether the compartment can be electrically silent;
  - and whether the field-input node cap (64) is affected.
- **What it touches.** The S3 lumen's accounting patterns, D150's exchange and identity rules, the
  D148 round for neutral species on membranes, the volume ledger, and roadmap item 9.

**The plan entry.** It sits in CURRENT_PLAN's composition gate, high priority, after the work in
flight.

## FR-2 — Internalisation of membrane and its populations

**Logged 14 November 2026, priority 2** (the request's label; the user: "first log this one"). The
request below is the requesting study's text, condensed. The lead's mapping follows.

**The request.** The retrieval direction of `scheduled_membrane_insertion@1`: membrane area,
capacitance and the populations on it move inward at a scheduled rate, carrying the compartment they
form (FR-1) with them.

**Why it is general.**
- endocytosis of every kind;
- receptor down-regulation and recycling;
- surface-population turnover, which the roadmap lists under membrane redistribution;
- synaptic vesicle recycling;
- membrane retrieval after division.

**What is missing, in the requester's reading.**
- Insertion@1 refuses retrieval because the capacitor's free energy would rise: its heat would be
  negative, and the work would need a declared source. The lead checked this:
  `membrane_insertion.py` refuses "a negative rate (retrieval: its heat would be negative, and the
  work would need a declared …)".
- The requester notes that finite ATP/ADP/Pi pools already exist, in the older calcium and energy
  families. Letting species laws draw on energy pools is deferred: D150 question 11, D152
  question 10 and D151.
- So a declared ATP-coupled retrieval law looks like the same question arriving twice, and one
  answer would serve both.

**Why the study needs it.** Receptor-mediated uptake depletes the surface pool and returns it. A sink
that never consumes its receptors cannot produce saturation, competition between neighbouring cells
for a shared dose, or the cell-to-cell variation that makes delivery selective.

**The lead's mapping (for its design note to test, not settled).**
- **It depends on FR-1.** The retrieved membrane carries the compartment FR-1 creates, so FR-2's
  design follows FR-1's.
- **The energy source is the design question.** Retrieval's work could come from:
  - a declared external reservoir, as D150's turnover and D152's driven routes book work today; or
  - a finite energy pool.

  The pools live in the older families, outside the composite, so drawing on them in the composite
  is new work. The energy-pool coupling deferred by D150 and D152 should be designed once and serve
  every consumer.
- **Populations move with the membrane.** Channel and pump populations on the retrieved area move
  inward with it: the receptor down-regulation the study needs. That touches membrane state's
  populations, S2's domains and insertion@2's bookings, and needs their accounting.
- **What it touches.** S3's insertion and membrane-state operators, D150 and D152's energy-pool door,
  FR-1's compartment, and the composition walls (the species operators refuse insertion today).

## FR-3 — The site-occupancy primitive

**Logged 14 November 2026, priority 2** (the request's label; the user: "then next one"). The request
below is the requesting study's text, condensed. The lead's mapping follows.

**The request.** Promote the primitive already specified as a door in
[D150 §2.5](SECRETED_SPECIES_TRANSPORT_DESIGN.md):
- binding sites as state on a membrane domain or contact, with one owner;
- bound and free in one material ledger, never a second copy;
- accessibility as a factor separate from stoichiometry;
- declared partition and reset rules at division and replacement.

**Why it is general.** D150's own list: kinetochore sites, junction docking and surface catalysis.
Add to it ligand–receptor signalling generally, and the engineered quorum-sensing consortia in the
13 November reading list, where a finite receptor pool reads the shared signal.

**What it builds on.**
- `membrane_entity_state@1`'s populations are the owner D150 identified.
- The day-one analytic guard is already derived (D150 §2.5; the lead checked it). The saturable
  sink is the quasi-steady limit of binding with internalisation:
  J = k_int R_T c / (K_M + c), K_M = (k_off + k_int)/k_on.

**Why the study needs it.** Accessibility separate from stoichiometry is not a detail. Uptake of the
same formulation differs by cell type through surface composition. The 2026 glycocalyx and
protein-corona work found heparan-sulfate dependence in some tested lines and not in others.
Accessibility is where that enters a model without naming a receptor.

**The lead's mapping (for its design note to test, not settled).**
- **D150 §2.5's four requirements are the contract.**
  - The bound amount is state on the site's owner. Binding and release are booked transfers
    with @3's free inventory, as `exchange_moved_fmol` is.
  - Version 1's import routes are the shape the internalisation step writes into.
- **Accessibility as a factor.**
  - It is a declared multiplier on the binding rate, separate from the site count.
  - It fits the coupling operator's factor form (D155 and D156: F ∈ [b, 1]) when accessibility
    is regulated, and is a plain per-domain parameter otherwise.
- **The links to FR-1 and FR-2.** Receptor-mediated uptake binds at the surface (FR-3),
  internalises the bound sites with their membrane (FR-2) and delivers the cargo into a
  compartment (FR-1). The three should be designed so the bound pool's identity survives each
  transfer.
- **The design order.** FR-3 can be designed before FR-1's code lands: its first version needs only
  membrane state and @3's free inventory, and its guard is analytic. Its internalisation step
  follows FR-2.
- **The sources.** The primitive must be designed from its own sources (kinetochore counting, the
  Hirano 2026 review in the paper backlog, receptor kinetics), not shaped by one consumer (D144).

## FR-4 — Compartment pH: a proton species, an acidifying pump, buffering

**Logged 14 November 2026, priority 1 (blocking)**, the request's label. The request itself sequences
it last of the block, after FR-1's compartment exists and can hold material. The request below is the
requesting study's text, condensed. The lead's mapping follows.

**The request.** Protons as a species, with a pump that can acidify a compartment against its
gradient, drawing on the existing fuel pools, plus buffering through the reaction operator.

**Why it is general.**
- endosomal and lysosomal acidification;
- the mitochondrial proton-motive force, which the roadmap wants for energetics;
- pH-dependent gating and enzyme activity;
- bicarbonate handling.

Cells has no pH anywhere today, and a whole-cell model needs it.

**The charge problem, in the requester's corrected reading.** The lead checked each point in the
code.
- **A proton row is legal in @3 itself.** `surface_tissue_spec.py` admits integer valences in
  [−8, 8], so a +1 species is a declarable ion row. The transport half starts from something that
  exists.
- **It cannot be a D150 or D152 inventory species.**
  - `inventory_species.py` fixes `valence=0`.
  - `parse_species` refuses a nonzero valence for all three species operators
    (`species_common.py`).
- **Buffering is D152's named door.** Its §3.2 lists, as later work, "closed reactions on charged
  species with Σ_s z_s ν_sr = 0 exactly (integer valences), such as buffering".
- **The counterion pathway is a physical modelling choice, not bookkeeping.** Acidifying a
  compartment without a parallel ion flux charges it. The counterion pathways and the pump's
  energy must be explicit.

**Numerics the requester expects to matter, which the lead agrees with.**
- pH 7.4 to 5.0 is 4e-5 to 1e-2 mM, against about 150 mM of ions. That is D150's µM–nM regime,
  where the shared IMEX energy bound was 1.7 to 1,721 times a species' whole free-energy change.
- D150's answer should transfer: a species-only guard world, a NumPy ΔG test per law, and
  per-species material floors and anchors.
- Buffering is an equilibrium with a large capacity ratio, expected to be the stiff part.

**The lead's mapping (for its design note to test, not settled).**
- **Three doors already drawn meet here:**
  - D152's charged closed reactions, for buffering;
  - the energy-pool coupling, for the pump's fuel (D150 question 11, D152 question 10, and FR-2's
    retrieval energy);
  - FR-1's electrical treatment, which a proton-carrying compartment makes unavoidable. It cannot
    be electrically silent.
- **The pump.** An acidifying pump is a new pump law on @3's patch: a V-ATPase-like stoichiometry,
  cited, with neutral naming. Its energy comes from a declared fuel. The fuel pools exist only in
  the older calcium and energy families, so drawing on them in the composite is the energy-pool
  door.
- **Stiffness.** D152 v1 refuses kinetics too stiff for the step (dt·L > 1). Buffering therefore
  needs either the stiff-kinetics door (a positive implicit half-step) or a rapid-buffer
  equilibrium treatment, each qualified. That is for the design note to choose.
- **pH-dependent gating and enzymes.** These read a charged source. Under the coupling operator
  (D156) that goes through its regulatory state, or through D152's read-only charged-species door.
- **The order.** After FR-1 and with FR-2's energy design, as the request itself sequences it.
